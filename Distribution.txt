Gray bats live in limestone karst areas in the southeastern United States. Summer and winter (hibernation) ranges overlap but are not identical. Hibernation occurs in caves in northern Alabama, northern Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Tennessee. During summer, the species ranges further and can be found in eastern Oklahoma and Kansas, southern Illinois and Indiana, southwestern Virginia, western North Carolina, northwestern South Carolina, and northern Georgia. A very small number of records from West Virginia and Mississippi are considered to represent vagrants. Historically attested populations in Florida appear to be absent as of 2020.[9] Gray bats are cave obligate (or cave dependent) bats, meaning that with very few exceptions (in which cave-like conditions are created in man-made structures like sewers and culverts) gray bats only live in caves, not in abandoned barns or other structures as other species of bats are known to do.[6] Less than 5% of all available caves are inhabited by gray bats.[6] Thus, any disturbance to these cave habitats can be extremely detrimental to gray bat populations.
